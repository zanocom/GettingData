## "Getting and Cleaning Data" Course project of 
## Data Science Specialization on Coursera.

Starting from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set [1]
provided through UCI Machine Learning repository
( http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones )
the project goal is to process raw data and provide a tidy data set.

In order to do so the repository contains: 
* a file CodeBook.md that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations performed to clean up the data
* a file run_analysis.R with the script for performing the analysis
* the final output file "tidy_dataset.txt" obtained from .zip file downloaded on "Sat Sep 13 08:27:37 2014"


In order to replicate the steps of getting and cleaning data we suppose
the file getdata-projectfiles-UCI HAR Dataset.zip is downloaded from 

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

and unzipped into the working directory.
